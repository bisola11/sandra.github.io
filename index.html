<font size="5" color="white" face="arial"</font>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My achievement started from primary school,being an innocent and hardworking child,I have achieved many great things
The first one was wen I started painting making different pictures of interest to people and also receiving good comments and prices from loved ones and interested people......I have drawn many legends like wole soyinka, Leonardo da vinci,Monaliza and so on
Like I said,have collected many prizes from those paintings.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And it never stopped....
Another achievement of mine was winning a spelling bee competition which I collected an award n I also made my principal very proud....
In fact, everyone was proud of me including my parents
I have never for once stopped achieving things in life and I never wished to stop
